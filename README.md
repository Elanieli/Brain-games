### Hello! Here is a set of little brain games:


* **brain-even**: you will see a random number and you should answer the number is even or not 
* **brain calc**: you will see a random math expression and you should enter the result 
* **brain-gcd**: you will see two random numbers and you should the enter greatest common divisor of them 
* **brain-progresiion**: you will see a random arithmetic progression with a missing number and you need to enter the number that should be in place of ".." 
* **brain-prime**: you will see a random number and you need to answer the number is prime or not 


In each of these games, you have to go through three rounds with different math questions. If you make a mistake, you will have to start this game again.
